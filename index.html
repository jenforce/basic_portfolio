          <div class="bio">
                  <p>  In my professional life, I am a experienced IT Product Management with skills centered around; project management, requirements gathering and creation of the artifacts to enable IT, hands on problems solving, but really everything  IT life cycle and getting technology delivered. 

                  I recently, embarked on a journey to change, change jobs, change industry hey change really anything. This page is an example of one of those changes and also of my work.  My  experience in HTML and CCS can be counted in weeks at this point, but case in point a good start and proves I work hard and as with most things its a work in progress.

                  Oh and when Im not coding I can be found outside maybe kayaking or hiking the usual stuff, I love food and most kinds of wine too - very normal right?</p>
